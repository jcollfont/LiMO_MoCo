# LiMO_MoCo
This is the public repository for the LiMo-MoCo method

The current version of the code contains calls that depend on the tools available at the CRKIT (http://crl.med.harvard.edu/software/) and external ELASTIX implementation. However, many of these could be modified to directly call ELASTIX through SimpleElastix (https://simpleelastix.github.io/).
